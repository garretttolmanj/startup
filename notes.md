# Unit 1 Notes
## Git
+ Git allows you to track files file versions in a directory
+ "git status" tells you what files have been changed on in the git directory
+ "git add ." stages and makes changes ready to be commited
+ "git commit -am" you always need to include a message when you commit your work. Adding the A allows means you don't have to add the changes before commiting.
+ "git log" shows every version after each commit. It provides a record.
+ Branching Sequence: "git branch A", "git checkout A", make changes to either, "git checkout master", "git merge A"
+ Use fork to make a copy of a repository.

## Simon -HTML

+ Start with a file called "index.html" which will be the starting page for your application.
+ Each page has a header, body and footer which should have the link to the github repository.
+ I need to make sure that my startup has the rubric points.
+ HTML is a markdown language.
+ use "\<form>" for the login button.
+ Things to use: "\<table>", "<\button>", "\<svg>"
+ Install "Live Server Extension for VSCode
