# Muscle Genius - A Lifter's App
## Description Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
Muscle Genius is a lifting app designed for people who love working out. The main feature is the interactive calendar which allows you to plan workouts and track your progress seamlessly. To start, simply select a day on the calendar and choose from a list of exercises. When an exercise has been chosen, enter how many sets and reps you plan to do. Capture every set, rep, and weight while working out to share your achievements and workout plans with your lifting buddies. Your heaviest weight lifted will be recorded in your personal stats! Get ready to lift some weights!

### Key Features
+ Secure login over HTTPS

+ Ability to view realtime data input from friends including their stats and workout-calendar \(users may only view not edit their friend's calendars)
### Technologies
+ HTML - I will use HTML to create the structure/backbone of my calendar application. There should be two HTML pages, one for login and one for the workout-calendar.
+ CSS - I will use CSS to style my calendar, title, tables, pop-ups, and dropdowns.
+ JavaScript - I will use JavaScript to make the entire workout calendar interactive including dropdown tables, pop-ups, and other icons.
+ Web service - I will use a web service to store and retrieve login information, workout data for the user's calendar and stats, list and interact with the user's friends. 
+ Authentication - I will use authentication technology for creating user accounts and logging in.
+ Database persistence - I will use database technology for storing user and friend's calendar data and for saving login information. I will also use a database for default exercises and a user's added personal exercises.
+ WebSocket - As each user inputs information, their stats and workout information are displayed to other users/friends.
+ Web framework - I will set up my app to use the React web framework. I want to make my application compatible with a laptop or a smartphone.
